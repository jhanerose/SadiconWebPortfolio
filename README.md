## 🛠️ Under the Hood: Technical Implementation
This portfolio combines clean semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create a performant and interactive user experience.

* **Responsive Layout:** Utilizes **media queries** and flexible containers to adapt seamlessly from mobile phones to wide desktop screens.
* **Smooth Navigation:** Bottom control icons use `data-id` attributes and JavaScript `scrollIntoView` for smooth section jumping.
* **Theme Toggle:** A dedicated button toggles a specific CSS class on the `<body>`, switching between **Dark** and **Light** modes instantly.
* **Dynamic Animations:** JavaScript detects scroll position to animate skill bars to their respective percentages dynamically.
* **Form Handling:** The contact form integrates with the **Formspree API**, sending submissions directly to email without a backend server.
* **Media Optimization:** Images are optimized for the web, and video is self-hosted using standard HTML5 controls.
